This Was the final task in the cyber sig. It was a web based task. Compared to Bandit tasks i found this one more challenging and confusing. but i tried my best to do all the 10 levels but i was only able to do upto level 8. The rest was difficult and i was not able to find the password. This was also very interesting and immersive task but a bit more difficult than bandit tasks. I will try to explore more and find the rest of the tasks.
