This was a Bandit task. Initially it was a bit confusing about how to do the task in the terminal. But after reading the references given in the task and the website i knew how to do the tasks. Initially the tasks were easy and i was able to complete the bandit task by using the commands which i have already studied. but as it goes on the difficulty increased. As it goes on i came across new commands which i didnt knew before. I used google as a reference to know more about those commands and impliment it in the the task and complete them. As i completed the task i was able to know about so many new commands that i didnt know. THis task was a very interesting sort of game where the amount of satisfaction we get from finding the password is very large. I really loved this task.
