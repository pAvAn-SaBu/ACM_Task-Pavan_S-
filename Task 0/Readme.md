In task 0 we were supposed to create a github and linked in account. I have created a github and linkedin account(whose ID is given in the readme.md file). I didnt face any difficulty in creating a linked in a Linkedin Account. It was fun and the interface was very new to me but i took my time to become familiarized with the interface. In the case of Github i faced some difficulties in creating the the account. The problem that i faced initially was due to my poor internet connection but later on after getting a stable internet connection i was able to continue my account creating process. Then I faced  a problem in the verification Captcha. The Captcha was not getting verified even though i was doing everything correctly. After restarting the browser a few times the problem was fixed and then i succesfully created a github account. The github user interface was also completely new to me. It took me some time learn about the interface and become Familirized with it. Now i am looking forward to do some interesting things in github.
