This Task was all about learing logic gates. I learned all about simple logic gates. I created logic gates in minecraft and it was fun. I was able to understand the complete working of logic gates from this. Even though i have played minecraft for so many times i never thought it would be this much useful in understanding about the concepts of logic gates. it was very much fun and interesting to create logic gates in minecraft using redstone.
